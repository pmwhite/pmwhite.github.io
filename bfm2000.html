  <h1>The Scriptures</h1>

  <p>The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God’s
  revelation of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of divine instruction.
  It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any
  mixture of error, for its matter. Therefore, all Scripture is totally true
  and trustworthy. It reveals the principles by which God judges us, and
  therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world, the true center of
  Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds,
  and religious opinions should be tried. All Scripture is a testimony to
  Christ, who is Himself the focus of divine revelation. </p>

<p><em>Exodus 24:4:</em> And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.</p><p><em>Deuteronomy 4:1-2:</em> Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do [them], that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you. Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish [ought] from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.</p><p><em>Deuteronomy 17:19:</em> And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:</p><p><em>Joshua 8:34:</em> And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</p><p><em>Psalm 19:7-10:</em> The law of the LORD [is] perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD [is] sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD [are] right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD [is] pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the LORD [is] clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD [are] true [and] righteous altogether. More to be desired [are they] than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</p><p><em>Psalm 119:11:</em> Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.</p><p><em>Psalm 119:89:</em> LAMED. For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.</p><p><em>Psalm 119:105:</em> NUN. Thy word [is] a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</p><p><em>Psalm 119:140:</em> Thy word [is] very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.</p><p><em>Isaiah 34:16:</em> Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.</p><p><em>Isaiah 40:8:</em> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.</p><p><em>Jeremiah 15:16:</em> Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.</p><p><em>Jeremiah 36:1-32:</em> And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, [that] this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day. It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book. And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I [am] shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD: Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD’S house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities. It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great [is] the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people. And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD’S house. And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, [that] they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem. Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S house, in the ears of all the people. When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD, Then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, [even] Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them. And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read [it] in their ears. Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words. And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth? Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote [them] with ink in the book. Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be. And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king. So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king. Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and [there was a fire] on the hearth burning before him. And it came to pass, [that] when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast [it] into the fire that [was] on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that [was] on the hearth. Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, [neither] the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them. But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them. Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast? Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not. Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.</p><p><em>Matthew 5:17-18:</em> Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</p><p><em>Matthew 22:29:</em> Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</p><p><em>Luke 21:33:</em> Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</p><p><em>Luke 24:44-46:</em> And he said unto them, These [are] the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and [in] the prophets, and [in] the psalms, concerning me. Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</p><p><em>John 5:39:</em> Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</p><p><em>John 16:13-15:</em> Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, [that] shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you.</p><p><em>John 17:17:</em> Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</p><p><em>Acts 2:16ff.:</em> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come: And it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance. Men [and] brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, Until I make thy foes thy footstool. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard [this], they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men [and] brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, [even] as many as the Lord our God shall call. And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added [unto them] about three thousand souls. And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. And all that believed were together, and had all things common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all [men], as every man had need. And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</p><p><em>Acts 17:11:</em> These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</p><p><em>Romans 15:4:</em> For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.</p><p><em>Romans 16:25-26:</em> Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:</p><p><em>2 Timothy 3:15-17:</em> And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</p><p><em>Hebrews 1:1-2:</em> God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us by [his] Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</p><p><em>Hebrews 4:12:</em> For the word of God [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p><p><em>1 Peter 1:25:</em> But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.</p><p><em>2 Peter 1:19-21:</em> We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake [as they were] moved by the Holy Ghost.</p></div>

  <h1>God</h1>

  <p>There is one and only one living and true God. He is an intelligent,
  spiritual, and personal Being, the Creator, Redeemer, Preserver, and Ruler of
  the universe. God is infinite in holiness and all other perfections. God is
  all powerful and all knowing; and His perfect knowledge extends to all
  things, past, present, and future, including the future decisions of His free
  creatures. To Him we owe the highest love, reverence, and obedience. The
  eternal triune God reveals Himself to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
  with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence,
  or being.</p>

  <h2>God the Father</h2>

  <p>God as Father reigns with providential care over His universe, His
  creatures, and the flow of the stream of human history according to the
  purposes of His grace. He is all powerful, all knowing, all loving, and all
  wise. God is Father in truth to those who become children of God through
  faith in Jesus Christ. He is fatherly in His attitude toward all men.</p>

Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people [which] thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided [them] in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. The people shall hear, [and] be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be [as] still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, [which] thou hast purchased. Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, [in] the place, O LORD, [which] thou hast made for thee to dwell in, [in] the Sanctuary, O Lord, [which] thy hands have established. The LORD shall reign for ever and ever. For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry [land] in the midst of the sea. And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they [were] bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, [which] when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I [am] the LORD that healeth thee. And they came to Elim, where [were] twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.</p><p><em>Exodus 20:1ff.:</em> And God spake all these words, saying, I [am] the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me; And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] within thy gates: For [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them [is], and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that [is] thy neighbour’s. And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw [it], they removed, and stood afar off. And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God [was]. And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee. And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.</p><p><em>Leviticus 22:2:</em> Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name [in those things] which they hallow unto me: I [am] the LORD.</p><p><em>Deuteronomy 6:4:</em> Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God [is] one LORD:</p><p><em>Deuteronomy 32:6:</em> Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise?

The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. [There is] no speech nor language, [where] their voice is not heard.</p><p><em>Isaiah 43:3:</em> For I [am] the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt [for] thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.</p><p><em>Isaiah 43:15:</em> I [am] the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.</p><p><em>Isaiah 64:8:</em> But now, O LORD, thou [art] our father; we [are] the clay, and thou our potter; and we all [are] the work of thy hand.</p><p><em>Jeremiah 10:10:</em> But the LORD [is] the true God, he [is] the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</p><p><em>Jeremiah 17:13:</em> O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, [and] they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.</p><p><em>Matthew 6:9ff.:</em> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as [it is] in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great [is] that darkness! No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, [shall he] not much more [clothe] you, O ye of little faith? Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day [is] the evil thereof.</p><p><em>Matthew 7:11:</em> If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</p><p><em>Matthew 23:9:</em> And call no [man] your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.</p><p><em>Matthew 28:19:</em> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</p><p><em>Mark 1:9-11:</em> And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: And there came a voice from heaven, [saying], Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p><p><em>John 4:24:</em> God [is] a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship [him] in spirit and in truth.</p><p><em>John 5:26:</em> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</p><p><em>John 14:6-13:</em> Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou [then], Shew us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I [am] in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater [works] than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.

  <h2>God the Son</h2>

  <p>Christ is the eternal Son of God. In His incarnation as Jesus Christ He
  was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. Jesus perfectly
  revealed and did the will of God, taking upon Himself human nature with its
  demands and necessities and identifying Himself completely with mankind yet
  without sin. He honored the divine law by His personal obedience, and in His
  substitutionary death on the cross He made provision for the redemption of
  men from sin. He was raised from the dead with a glorified body and appeared
  to His disciples as the person who was with them before His crucifixion. He
  ascended into heaven and is now exalted at the right hand of God where He is
  the One Mediator, fully God, fully man, in whose Person is effected the
  reconciliation between God and man. He will return in power and glory to
  judge the world and to consummate His redemptive mission. He now dwells in
  all believers as the living and ever present Lord.</p>

<p><em>Genesis 18:1ff.:</em> And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw [them], he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead [it], and make cakes upon the hearth. And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave [it] unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set [it] before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. And they said unto him, Where [is] Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard [it] in the tent door, which [was] behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah [were] old [and] well stricken in age; [and] it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that [are] therein? That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which [am but] dust and ashes: Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for [lack of] five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy [it]. And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do [it] for forty’s sake. And he said [unto him], Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do [it], if I find thirty there. And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for twenty’s sake. And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for ten’s sake. And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</p><p><em>Psalm 2:7ff.:</em> I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou [art] my Son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall give [thee] the heathen [for] thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth [for] thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel. Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish [from] the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed [are] all they that put their trust in him.</p><p><em>Psalm 110:1ff.:</em> A Psalm of David. The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Thy people [shall be] willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth. The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill [the places] with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries. He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.</p><p><em>Isaiah 7:14:</em> Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</p><p><em>Isaiah 53:1-12:</em> Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, [there is] no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were [our] faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he [was] wounded for our transgressions, [he was] bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace [was] upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither [was any] deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put [him] to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see [his] seed, he shall prolong [his] days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul, [and] shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him [a portion] with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p><p><em>Matthew 1:18-23:</em> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just [man], and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</p><p><em>Matthew 3:17:</em> And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p><p><em>Matthew 8:29:</em> And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</p><p><em>Matthew 11:27:</em> All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and [he] to whomsoever the Son will reveal [him].</p><p><em>Matthew 14:33:</em> Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</p><p><em>Matthew 16:16:</em> And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</p><p><em>Matthew 16:27:</em> For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.</p><p><em>Matthew 17:5:</em> While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</p><p><em>Matthew 17:27:</em> Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.</p><p><em>Matthew 28:1-6:</em> In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead [men]. And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</p><p><em>Matthew 28:19:</em> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</p><p><em>Mark 1:1:</em> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</p><p><em>Mark 3:11:</em> And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</p><p><em>Luke 1:35:</em> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</p><p><em>Luke 4:41:</em> And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking [them] suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.</p><p><em>Luke 22:70:</em> Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</p><p><em>Luke 24:46:</em> And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</p><p><em>John 1:1-18:</em> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. There was a man sent from God, whose name [was] John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all [men] through him might believe. He was not that Light, but [was sent] to bear witness of that Light. [That] was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me. And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, [but] grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].</p><p><em>John 1:29:</em> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</p><p><em>John 10:30:</em> I and [my] Father are one.</p><p><em>John 10:38:</em> But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father [is] in me, and I in him.</p><p><em>John 11:25-27:</em> Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</p><p><em>John 12:44-50:</em> Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</p><p><em>John 14:7-11:</em> If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou [then], Shew us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I [am] in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.</p><p><em>John 16:15-16:</em> All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you. A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</p><p><em>John 16:28:</em> I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</p><p><em>John 17:1-5:</em> These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</p><p><em>John 17:21-22:</em> That they all may be one; as thou, Father, [art] in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:</p><p><em>John 20:1-20:</em> The first [day] of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. And he stooping down, [and looking in], saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, [and looked] into the sepulchre, And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and [to] my God, and your God. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] he had spoken these things unto her. Then the same day at evening, being the first [day] of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you. And when he had so said, he shewed unto them [his] hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</p><p><em>John 20:28:</em> And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</p><p><em>Acts 1:9:</em> And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</p><p><em>Acts 2:22-24:</em> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</p><p><em>Acts 7:55-56:</em> But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.</p><p><em>Acts 9:4-5:</em> And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: [it is] hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</p><p><em>Acts 9:20:</em> And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</p><p><em>Romans 1:3-4:</em> Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; And declared [to be] the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</p><p><em>Romans 3:23-26:</em> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, [I say], at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</p><p><em>Romans 5:6-21:</em> For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And not only [so], but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. But not as the offence, so also [is] the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. And not as [it was] by one that sinned, [so is] the gift: for the judgment [was] by one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offences unto justification. For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) Therefore as by the offence of one [judgment came] upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one [the free gift came] upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</p><p><em>Romans 8:1-3:</em> [There is] therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</p><p><em>Romans 8:34:</em> Who [is] he that condemneth? [It is] Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</p><p><em>Romans 10:4:</em> For Christ [is] the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.</p><p><em>1 Corinthians 1:30:</em> But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</p><p><em>1 Corinthians 2:2:</em> For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</p><p><em>1 Corinthians 8:6:</em> But to us [there is but] one God, the Father, of whom [are] all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom [are] all things, and we by him.</p><p><em>1 Corinthians 15:1-8:</em> Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.</p><p><em>1 Corinthians 15:24-28:</em> Then [cometh] the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy [that] shall be destroyed [is] death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under [him, it is] manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</p><p><em>2 Corinthians 5:19-21:</em> To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech [you] by us: we pray [you] in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him [to be] sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</p><p><em>2 Corinthians 8:9:</em> For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</p><p><em>Galatians 4:4-5:</em> But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</p><p><em>Ephesians 1:20:</em> Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set [him] at his own right hand in the heavenly [places],</p><p><em>Ephesians 3:11:</em> According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</p><p><em>Ephesians 4:7-10:</em> But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)</p><p><em>Philippians 2:5-11:</em> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven, and [things] in earth, and [things] under the earth; And [that] every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p><p><em>Colossians 1:13-22:</em> Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated [us] into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, [even] the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether [they be] thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all [things] he might have the preeminence. For it pleased [the Father] that in him should all fulness dwell; And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, [I say], whether [they be] things in earth, or things in heaven. And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in [your] mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:</p><p><em>Colossians 2:9:</em> For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</p><p><em>1 Thessalonians 4:14-18:</em> For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p><p><em>1 Timothy 2:5-6:</em> For [there is] one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</p><p><em>1 Timothy 3:16:</em> And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</p><p><em>Titus 2:13-14:</em> Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p><p><em>Hebrews 1:1-3:</em> God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us by [his] Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; Who being the brightness of [his] glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</p><p><em>Hebrews 4:14-15:</em> Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.</p><p><em>Hebrews 7:14-28:</em> For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life. For he testifieth, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did]; by the which we draw nigh unto God. And inasmuch as not without an oath [he was made priest]: (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:) By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death: But this [man], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. For such an high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, [maketh] the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</p><p><em>Hebrews 9:12-15:</em> Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [for us]. For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</p><p><em>Hebrews 9:24-28:</em> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, [which are] the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.</p><p><em>Hebrews 12:2:</em> Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of [our] faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</p><p><em>Hebrews 13:8:</em> Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</p><p><em>1 Peter 2:21-25:</em> For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed [himself] to him that judgeth righteously: Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</p><p><em>1 Peter 3:22:</em> Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</p><p><em>1 John 1:7-9:</em> But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p><p><em>1 John 3:2:</em> Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</p><p><em>1 John 4:14-15:</em> And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son [to be] the Saviour of the world. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</p><p><em>1 John 5:9:</em> If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.</p><p><em>Revelation 1:13-16:</em> And in the midst of the seven candlesticks [one] like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. His head and [his] hairs [were] white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes [were] as a flame of fire; And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance [was] as the sun shineth in his strength.</p><p><em>Revelation 5:9-14:</em> And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, [be] unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four [and] twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</p><p><em>Revelation 12:10-11:</em> And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</p><p><em>Revelation 13:8:</em> And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</p><p><em>Revelation 19:16:</em> And he hath on [his] vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</p></div>

  <h2>God the Holy Spirit</h2>

  <p>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, fully divine. He inspired holy men
  of old to write the Scriptures. Through illumination He enables men to
  understand truth. He exalts Christ. He convicts men of sin, of righteousness,
  and of judgment. He calls men to the Saviour, and effects regeneration. At
  the moment of regeneration He baptizes every believer into the Body of
  Christ. He cultivates Christian character, comforts believers, and bestows
  the spiritual gifts by which they serve God through His church. He seals the
  believer unto the day of final redemption. His presence in the Christian is
  the guarantee that God will bring the believer into the fullness of the
  stature of Christ. He enlightens and empowers the believer and the church in
  worship, evangelism, and service.</p>

If I ascend up into heaven, thou [art] there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou [art there]. [If] I take the wings of the morning, [and] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light [are] both alike [to thee]. For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully [and] wonderfully made: marvellous [are] thy works; and [that] my soul knoweth right well. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, [and] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all [my members] were written, [which] in continuance were fashioned, when [as yet there was] none of them. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! [If] I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. For they speak against thee wickedly, [and] thine enemies take [thy name] in vain. Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies. Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: And see if [there be any] wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</p><p><em>Isaiah 61:1-3:</em> The Spirit of the Lord GOD [is] upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to [them that are] bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.</p><p><em>Joel 2:28-32:</em> And it shall come to pass afterward, [that] I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come. And it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.</p><p><em>Matthew 1:18:</em> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</p><p><em>Matthew 3:16:</em> And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</p><p><em>Matthew 4:1:</em> Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</p><p><em>Matthew 12:28-32:</em> But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy [against] the [Holy] Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the [world] to come.</p><p><em>Matthew 28:19:</em> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</p><p><em>Mark 1:10:</em> And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</p><p><em>Mark 1:12:</em> And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</p><p><em>Luke 1:35:</em> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</p><p><em>Luke 4:1:</em> And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</p><p><em>Luke 4:18-19:</em> The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</p><p><em>Luke 11:13:</em> If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall [your] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</p><p><em>Luke 12:12:</em> For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.</p><p><em>Luke 24:49:</em> And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</p><p><em>John 4:24:</em> God [is] a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship [him] in spirit and in truth.</p><p><em>John 14:16-17:</em> And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; [Even] the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</p><p><em>John 14:26:</em> But the Comforter, [which is] the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</p><p><em>John 15:26:</em> But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:</p><p><em>John 16:7-14:</em> Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: Of sin, because they believe not on me; Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, [that] shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you.</p><p><em>Acts 1:8:</em> But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</p><p><em>Acts 2:1-4:</em> And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p><p><em>Acts 2:38:</em> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p><p><em>Acts 4:31:</em> And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</p><p><em>Acts 5:3:</em> But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back [part] of the price of the land?</p><p><em>Acts 6:3:</em> Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</p><p><em>Acts 7:55:</em> But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,</p><p><em>Acts 8:17:</em> Then laid they [their] hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</p><p><em>Acts 8:39:</em> And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</p><p><em>Acts 10:44:</em> While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</p><p><em>Acts 13:2:</em> As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</p><p><em>Acts 15:28:</em> For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;</p><p><em>Acts 16:6:</em> Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,</p><p><em>Acts 19:1-6:</em> And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard [this], they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid [his] hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</p><p><em>Romans 8:9-11:</em> But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ [be] in you, the body [is] dead because of sin; but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</p><p><em>Romans 8:14-16:</em> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</p><p><em>Romans 8:26-27:</em> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to [the will of] God.</p><p><em>1 Corinthians 2:10-14:</em> But God hath revealed [them] unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned.</p><p><em>1 Corinthians 3:16:</em> Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</p><p><em>1 Corinthians 12:3-11:</em> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and [that] no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another [divers] kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</p><p><em>1 Corinthians 12:13:</em> For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</p><p><em>Galatians 4:6:</em> And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</p><p><em>Ephesians 1:13-14:</em> In whom ye also [trusted], after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</p><p><em>Ephesians 4:30:</em> And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</p><p><em>Ephesians 5:18:</em> And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</p><p><em>1 Thessalonians 5:19:</em> Quench not the Spirit.</p><p><em>1 Timothy 3:16:</em> And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</p><p><em>1 Timothy 4:1:</em> Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</p><p><em>2 Timothy 1:14:</em> That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</p><p><em>2 Timothy 3:16:</em> All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</p><p><em>Hebrews 9:8:</em> The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</p><p><em>Hebrews 9:14:</em> How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</p><p><em>2 Peter 1:21:</em> For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake [as they were] moved by the Holy Ghost.</p><p><em>1 John 4:13:</em> Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</p><p><em>1 John 5:6-7:</em> This is he that came by water and blood, [even] Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.</p><p><em>Revelation 1:10:</em> I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</p><p><em>Revelation 22:17:</em> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</p></div>

  <h1>Man</h1>

  <p>Man is the special creation of God, made in His own image. He created them
  male and female as the crowning work of His creation. The gift of gender is
  thus part of the goodness of God’s creation. In the beginning man was
  innocent of sin and was endowed by his Creator with freedom of choice. By his
  free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into the human race.
  Through the temptation of Satan man transgressed the command of God, and fell
  from his original innocence whereby his posterity inherit a nature and an
  environment inclined toward sin. Therefore, as soon as they are capable of
  moral action, they become transgressors and are under condemnation. Only the
  grace of God can bring man into His holy fellowship and enable man to fulfill
  the creative purpose of God. The sacredness of human personality is evident
  in that God created man in His own image, and in that Christ died for man;
  therefore, every person of every race possesses full dignity and is worthy of
  respect and Christian love.</p>

  <h1>Salvation</h1>

  <p>Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man, and is offered freely
  to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, who by His own blood
  obtained eternal redemption for the believer. In its broadest sense salvation
  includes regeneration, justification, sanctification, and glorification.
  There is no salvation apart from personal faith in Jesus Christ as Lord.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Regeneration, or the new birth, is a work of God’s grace
      whereby believers become new creatures in Christ Jesus. It is a change of
      heart wrought by the Holy Spirit through conviction of sin, to which the
      sinner responds in repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus
      Christ. Repentance and faith are inseparable experiences of grace.</p>

      <p>Repentance is a genuine turning from sin toward God. Faith is the
      acceptance of Jesus Christ and commitment of the entire personality to
      Him as Lord and Saviour.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Justification is God’s gracious and full acquittal upon principles
      of His righteousness of all sinners who repent and believe in Christ.
      Justification brings the believer unto a relationship of peace and favor
    with God.<p></li>
    <li><p>Sanctification is the experience, beginning in regeneration, by
      which the believer is set apart to God’s purposes, and is enabled to
      progress toward moral and spiritual maturity through the presence and
      power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in him. Growth in grace should continue
      throughout the regenerate person’s life.<p></li>
    <li><p>Glorification is the culmination of salvation and is the final
      blessed and abiding state of the redeemed.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <h1>God's Purpose of Grace</h1>

  <p>Election is the gracious purpose of God, according to which He
  regenerates, justifies, sanctifies, and glorifies sinners. It is consistent
  with the free agency of man, and comprehends all the means in connection with
  the end. It is the glorious display of God’s sovereign goodness, and is
  infinitely wise, holy, and unchangeable. It excludes boasting and promotes
  humility.</p>

  <p>All true believers endure to the end. Those whom God has accepted in
  Christ, and sanctified by His Spirit, will never fall away from the state of
  grace, but shall persevere to the end. Believers may fall into sin through
  neglect and temptation, whereby they grieve the Spirit, impair their graces
  and comforts, and bring reproach on the cause of Christ and temporal
  judgments on themselves; yet they shall be kept by the power of God through
  faith unto salvation.</p>

  <h1>The Church</h1>

  <p>A New Testament church of the Lord Jesus Christ is an autonomous local
  congregation of baptized believers, associated by covenant in the faith and
  fellowship of the gospel; observing the two ordinances of Christ, governed by
  His laws, exercising the gifts, rights, and privileges invested in them by
  His Word, and seeking to extend the gospel to the ends of the earth. Each
  congregation operates under the Lordship of Christ through democratic
  processes. In such a congregation each member is responsible and accountable
  to Christ as Lord. Its two scriptural offices are that of
  pastor/elder/overseer and deacon. While both men and women are gifted for
  service in the church, the office of pastor/elder/overseer is limited to men
  as qualified by Scripture.</p>

  <p>The New Testament speaks also of the church as the Body of Christ which
  includes all of the redeemed of all the ages, believers from every tribe, and
  tongue, and people, and nation.</p>

  <h1>Baptism and the Lord's Supper</h1>

  <p>Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of
  the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is an act of obedience
  symbolizing the believer’s faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour,
  the believer’s death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection
  to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus. It is a testimony to his faith in
  the final resurrection of the dead. Being a church ordinance, it is
  prerequisite to the privileges of church membership and to the Lord’s
  Supper.</p>

  <p>The Lord’s Supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby members of the
  church, through partaking of the bread and the fruit of the vine, memorialize
  the death of the Redeemer and anticipate His second coming.</p>

  <h1>The Lord's Day</h1>

  <p>The first day of the week is the Lord’s Day. It is a Christian institution
  for regular observance. It commemorates the resurrection of Christ from the
  dead and should include exercises of worship and spiritual devotion, both
  public and private. Activities on the Lord’s Day should be commensurate with
  the Christian’s conscience under the Lordship of Jesus Christ.</p>

  <h1>The Kingdom</h1>

  <p>The Kingdom of God includes both His general sovereignty over the universe
  and His particular kingship over men who willfully acknowledge Him as King.
  Particularly the Kingdom is the realm of salvation into which men enter by
  trustful, childlike commitment to Jesus Christ. Christians ought to pray and
  to labor that the Kingdom may come and God’s will be done on earth. The full
  consummation of the Kingdom awaits the return of Jesus Christ and the end of
  this age.</p>

  <h1>Last Things</h1>

  <p>God, in His own time and in His own way, will bring the world to its
  appropriate end. According to His promise, Jesus Christ will return
  personally and visibly in glory to the earth; the dead will be raised; and
  Christ will judge all men in righteousness. The unrighteous will be consigned
  to Hell, the place of everlasting punishment. The righteous in their
  resurrected and glorified bodies will receive their reward and will dwell
  forever in Heaven with the Lord.</p>

  <h1>Evangelism and Missions</h1>

  <p>It is the duty and privilege of every follower of Christ and of every
  church of the Lord Jesus Christ to endeavor to make disciples of all nations.
  The new birth of man’s spirit by God’s Holy Spirit means the birth of love
  for others. Missionary effort on the part of all rests thus upon a spiritual
  necessity of the regenerate life, and is expressly and repeatedly commanded
  in the teachings of Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ has commanded the preaching
  of the gospel to all nations. It is the duty of every child of God to seek
  constantly to win the lost to Christ by verbal witness undergirded by a
  Christian lifestyle, and by other methods in harmony with the gospel of
  Christ.</p>

  <h1>Education</h1>

  <p>Christianity is the faith of enlightenment and intelligence. In Jesus
  Christ abide all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. All sound learning
  is, therefore, a part of our Christian heritage. The new birth opens all
  human faculties and creates a thirst for knowledge. Moreover, the cause of
  education in the Kingdom of Christ is co-ordinate with the causes of missions
  and general benevolence, and should receive along with these the liberal
  support of the churches. An adequate system of Christian education is
  necessary to a complete spiritual program for Christ’s people.</p>

  <p>In Christian education there should be a proper balance between academic
  freedom and academic responsibility. Freedom in any orderly relationship of
  human life is always limited and never absolute. The freedom of a teacher in
  a Christian school, college, or seminary is limited by the pre-eminence of
  Jesus Christ, by the authoritative nature of the Scriptures, and by the
  distinct purpose for which the school exists.</p>

  <h1>Stewardship</h1>

  <p>God is the source of all blessings, temporal and spiritual; all that we
  have and are we owe to Him. Christians have a spiritual debtorship to the
  whole world, a holy trusteeship in the gospel, and a binding stewardship in
  their possessions. They are therefore under obligation to serve Him with
  their time, talents, and material possessions; and should recognize all these
  as entrusted to them to use for the glory of God and for helping others.
  According to the Scriptures, Christians should contribute of their means
  cheerfully, regularly, systematically, proportionately, and liberally for the
  advancement of the Redeemer’s cause on earth.</p>

  <h1>Cooperation</h1>

  <p>Christ’s people should, as occasion requires, organize such associations
  and conventions as may best secure cooperation for the great objects of the
  Kingdom of God. Such organizations have no authority over one another or over
  the churches. They are voluntary and advisory bodies designed to elicit,
  combine, and direct the energies of our people in the most effective manner.
  Members of New Testament churches should cooperate with one another in
  carrying forward the missionary, educational, and benevolent ministries for
  the extension of Christ’s Kingdom. Christian unity in the New Testament sense
  is spiritual harmony and voluntary cooperation for common ends by various
  groups of Christ’s people. Cooperation is desirable between the various
  Christian denominations, when the end to be attained is itself justified, and
  when such cooperation involves no violation of conscience or compromise of
  loyalty to Christ and His Word as revealed in the New Testament.</p>

  <h1>The Christian and the Social Order</h1>

  <p>All Christians are under obligation to seek to make the will of Christ
  supreme in our own lives and in human society. Means and methods used for the
  improvement of society and the establishment of righteousness among men can
  be truly and permanently helpful only when they are rooted in the
  regeneration of the individual by the saving grace of God in Jesus Christ. In
  the spirit of Christ, Christians should oppose racism, every form of greed,
  selfishness, and vice, and all forms of sexual immorality, including
  adultery, homosexuality, and pornography. We should work to provide for the
  orphaned, the needy, the abused, the aged, the helpless, and the sick. We
  should speak on behalf of the unborn and contend for the sanctity of all
  human life from conception to natural death. Every Christian should seek to
  bring industry, government, and society as a whole under the sway of the
  principles of righteousness, truth, and brotherly love. In order to promote
  these ends Christians should be ready to work with all men of good will in
  any good cause, always being careful to act in the spirit of love without
  compromising their loyalty to Christ and His truth.</p>

  <h1>Peace and War</h1>

  <p>It is the duty of Christians to seek peace with all men on principles of
  righteousness. In accordance with the spirit and teachings of Christ they
  should do all in their power to put an end to war.</p>

  <p>The true remedy for the war spirit is the gospel of our Lord. The supreme
  need of the world is the acceptance of His teachings in all the affairs of
  men and nations, and the practical application of His law of love. Christian
  people throughout the world should pray for the reign of the Prince of
  Peace.</p>

  <h1>Religious Liberty</h1>

  <p>God alone is Lord of the conscience, and He has left it free from the
  doctrines and commandments of men which are contrary to His Word or not
  contained in it. Church and state should be separate. The state owes to every
  church protection and full freedom in the pursuit of its spiritual ends. In
  providing for such freedom no ecclesiastical group or denomination should be
  favored by the state more than others. Civil government being ordained of
  God, it is the duty of Christians to render loyal obedience thereto in all
  things not contrary to the revealed will of God. The church should not resort
  to the civil power to carry on its work. The gospel of Christ contemplates
  spiritual means alone for the pursuit of its ends. The state has no right to
  impose penalties for religious opinions of any kind. The state has no right
  to impose taxes for the support of any form of religion. A free church in a
  free state is the Christian ideal, and this implies the right of free and
  unhindered access to God on the part of all men, and the right to form and
  propagate opinions in the sphere of religion without interference by the
  civil power.</p>

  <h1>The Family</h1>

  <p>God has ordained the family as the foundational institution of human
  society. It is composed of persons related to one another by marriage, blood,
  or adoption.</p>

  <p>Marriage is the uniting of one man and one woman in covenant commitment
  for a lifetime. It is God’s unique gift to reveal the union between Christ
  and His church and to provide for the man and the woman in marriage the
  framework for intimate companionship, the channel of sexual expression
  according to biblical standards, and the means for procreation of the human
  race.</p>

  <p>The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created
  in God’s image. The marriage relationship models the way God relates to His
  people. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. He has the
  God-given responsibility to provide for, to protect, and to lead his family.
  A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her
  husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ. She,
  being in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the
  God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in
  managing the household and nurturing the next generation.</p>

  <p>Children, from the moment of conception, are a blessing and heritage from
  the Lord. Parents are to demonstrate to their children God’s pattern for
  marriage. Parents are to teach their children spiritual and moral values and
  to lead them, through consistent lifestyle example and loving discipline, to
  make choices based on biblical truth. Children are to honor and obey their
  parents.</p>
