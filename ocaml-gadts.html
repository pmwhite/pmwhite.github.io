    <h1>How to understand OCaml's GADTs.</h1>

    <p>OCaml has this weird feature of its type system called "Generalized
    Algebraic Data Types", or GADTs, for short. Experts typically use this
    feature to haze newcomers to the language. (unintentionally, of course)
    This page aims to fix this problem by enabling the reader to be the expert
    inflicting the suffering, rather than the sufferer.</p>

    <p>The first step I want to take is to re-frame your understanding of "normal"
    variant constructors: constructors are just plain old functions. In OCaml,
    this is a bit of a lie, but it's not <em>too</em> far off; we can't pass
    constructors around as first-class functions, but building something with
    them looks pretty similar to calling a function.</p>

    <p>Here's the <code>option</code> type in OCaml.</p>

    <pre>
<kw>type</kw> 'a <type>option</type> =
  | None
  | Some <kw>of</kw> 'a</pre>

    <p>This is the syntax we would usually use, but there is alternate syntax that
    lets you write the constructor as if it were a function.</p>

    <pre>
<kw>type</kw> 'a <type>option</type> =
  | None : 'a <type>option</type>
  | Some : 'a -> 'a <type>option</type></pre>

    <p>That's really not too far from what you often see in OCaml module
    signatures.</p>

    <pre>
<kw>type</kw> 'a <type>option</type>

<kw>val</kw> none : 'a <type>option</type>
<kw>val</kw> some : 'a -> 'a <type>option</type></pre>

    <p>What I just showed you was a translation from presenting
    <code>option</code> as a list of constructors to presenting it as a list of
    functions. You can go the other way too! Consider this subset of the
    <code>List</code> module.</p>

    <pre>
<kw>type</kw> 'a <type>list</type>

<kw>val</kw> empty : 'a <type>list</type>
<kw>val</kw> cons : 'a -> 'a <type>list</type> -> 'a <type>list</type>
<kw>val</kw> map : 'a <type>list</type> -> f:('a -> 'b) -> 'b <type>list</type></pre>

    <p>Translating this back to constructors is not immediately straightforward
    because constructors are only allowed to take a single parameter, so let's
    start with the intermediate step of translating these curried functions
    into functions that take a tuple of arguments.</p>

    <pre>
type 'a list

<kw>val</kw> empty : 'a <type>list</type>
<kw>val</kw> cons : 'a * 'a <type>list</type> -> 'a <type>list</type>
<kw>val</kw> map : 'a <type>list</type> * ('a -> 'b) -> 'b <type>list</type></pre>

    <p>Now it should be easy to translate these functions to constructors.</p>

    <pre>
<kw>type</kw> 'a <type>list</type> =
  | Empty : 'a <type>list</type>
  | Cons : 'a * 'a <type>list</type> -> 'a <type>list</type>
  | Map : 'a <type>list</type> * ('a -> 'b) -> 'b <type>list</type></pre>

    <p>It's perfectly understandable if the <code>Map</code> constructor is a
    bit baffling. We're used to <code>List.map</code> being a function that
    <em>does</em> something, but here we've just packaged it up as some data.
    On the other hand, if you're comfortable with functions being first-class
    values, then this shouldn't bother you at all; <code>Map</code> is just an
    ordinary constructor that contains two pieces of sub-data.</p>

    <p>One way to look at constructors is that they are functions the don't do
    anything in the moment, but then later you can look at them to see what
    parameters they were called with. We can pattern match on the fancy list
    type and eliminate the <code>Map</code> constructor by actually doing the
    mapping.</p>

    <pre>
<kw>let</kw> <kw>rec</kw> do_maps : <kw>type</kw> a. (a -> b) -> a <type>list</type> -> b <type>list</type> =
  <kw>fun</kw> f xs ->
    <kw>match</kw> xs <kw>with</kw>
    | Empty -> Empty
    | Cons (x, xs) -> Cons (f x, do_maps f xs)
    | Map (xs, g) -> do_maps (<kw>fun</kw> x -> f (g x)) xs</pre>

    <p>Don't worry if this looks foreign; it's a really weird function. In
    fact, it's even weirder than you probably realize; the type inference
    algorithm is hiding some of the nuance of this code. The key point of
    intrigue is in what type the <code>xs</code> variable has in the pattern
    <code>Map (xs, g)</code>; it's worth pondering for a minute or two before
    reading on.</p>

    <p>The answer is that the compiler has to make up a temporary abstract type
    for parameter of the list, so <code>xs</code> has a type like <code>$1 <type>list</type></code>.
    The <code>$1</code> is the type of the list items when
    <code>Map</code> was originally called, but the compiler doesn't remember
    what the type is, so the body of that match case has to treat it as an
    abstract type. In other words, we know there <em>exists</em> a type for the
    items of that list, but we don't know what it is. Weird, huh?</p>

    <h2>Normal variants are more limited than GADTs.</h2>

    <p>This is the section of the post where we start talking about GADTs. Just
    kidding! We've been talking about GADTs this whole time; did you
    notice? GADTs are not a new kind of thing, but rather an extension of
    the abilities of an existing thing, namely variants.</p>

    <p>The view that constructors are like functions is helpful for seeing the
    extra power that GADTs provide. The ordinary <code><kw>of</kw></code>-syntax for
    variants requires any type parameters in the parameters to be matched by
    type parameters in the type itself. For example, here is some invalid code
    in which we try to define the fancy list type with <code><kw>of</kw></code>-syntax.</p>

    <pre>
<kw>type</kw> 'a <type>list</type> =
  | Empty
  | Cons <kw>of</kw> 'a * 'a <type>list</type>
  | Map <kw>of</kw> 'x <type>list</type> * ('x -> 'a)</pre>

    <p>The <code>Map</code> constructor here is illegal because it mentions a
    <code>'x</code> variable that wasn't mentioned in <code><type>list</type></code>'s type
    parameters.</p>

    <p>Another limitation on constructor "functions" enforced by
    <code><kw>of</kw></code>-syntax is that the result of the function is always the
    type itself, with its unadorned type variables. To illustrate this, let us
    try to translate the <code>zip</code> function to a constructor.</p>

    <pre>
<kw>val</kw> zip : 'a <type>list</type> -> 'b <type>list</type> -> ('a * 'b) <type>list</type></pre>

    <p>Doing it with the new syntax we learned is easy.</p>

    <pre>
  | Zip : 'a <type>list</type> * 'b <type>list</type> -> ('a * 'b) <type>list</type></pre>

    <p>It should be similarly easy to do this with <code><kw>of</kw></code>-syntax, right?
    After all, all the type variables in the parameters <em>do</em> show up in
    the result.</p>

    <pre>
  | Zip <kw>of</kw> 'a <type>list</type> * 'b <type>list</type></pre>

    <p>Wait, but how do we say that the result is <code>('a * 'b) list</code>?
    That's exactly the problem. We might try to add it in the type declaration.</p>

    <pre>
<kw>type</kw> ('a * 'b) <type>list</type> =
  | Zip <kw>of</kw> 'a <type>list</type> * 'b <type>list</type></pre>

    <p>But this is not allowed.</p>

    <h2>Why are GADTs scary?</h2>

    <p>I think the idea that constructors are like functions is pretty
    approachable. So why do people find GADTs so scary? One reason is that
    people often given scary explanations of GADTS, sadly. However, another
    reason is that they are legitimately more complicated to use. It turns out
    that the limitations afforded by the <code><kw>of</kw></code>-syntax of normal
    variants prevents weird type situations (like with <code>do_maps</code>)
    from arising.</p>

    <pre>
<kw>let</kw> <kw>rec</kw> do_maps : <kw>type</kw> a. (a -> b) -> a <type>list</type> -> b <type>list</type> =
  <kw>fun</kw> f xs ->
    <kw>match</kw> xs <kw>with</kw>
    | Empty -> Empty
    | Cons (x, xs) -> Cons (f x, do_maps f xs)
    | Map (xs, g) -> do_maps (<kw>fun</kw> x -> f (g x)) xs</pre>

    <p>We already mentioned that the compiler has to make up some types in the
    middle of this function. However, we didn't address another crucial piece
    of this code.</p>

    <pre>
<kw>let</kw> <kw>rec</kw> do_maps : <em><kw>type</kw> a. (a -> b) -> a <type>list</type> -> b <type>list</type></em> =
  ...</pre>

    <p>While this may look like any other type annotation, it's actually a special
    kind that allows this function to do "polymorphic recursion". The reason is
    that the recursive calls in <code>do_maps</code> may have to run on lists
    of many different types, due to the flexibility added by the
    <code>Map</code> constructor.</p>

    <p>Understanding every part of this example is unnecessary to grasp the point
    that GADTs do make things more complicated.</p>

    <h2>When should I use GADTs?</h2>

    <p>This is the wrong question. You shouldn't be choosing between normal
    variants and GADTs. Instead, think of constructors as functions whose calls
    you want to inspect later. You'll know you need a GADT if the type
    signatures of those functions violate the rules of OCaml's
    <code><kw>of</kw></code>-syntax. (the compiler will tell you when that happens)</p>

    <p>Fortunately, most variants don't need the extra power. It would be sad
    if they did, since several things get worse with GADTs. For instance, you
    need more type annotations to make the compiler happy. Related to this,
    OCaml's <code>ppx_deriving</code> extensions don't work because they don't
    have access to type information, so they can't generate the proper type
    information required by generated code.</p>

    To me, the bottom line is that you should use them if they are useful, with
    a slight bias toward avoiding them, since they tend to increase code noise.
