    <h1>Opinions about crossword clues.</h1>

    <p>If you aren't aware, my website has a bunch of 
    <a href="crosswords.html">crossword puzzles</a> on it, written by various
    friends and family. In my editing of these puzzles, I've tried to adhere to
    an implicit language that I've noticed in other crossword puzzles that I've
    played. The page is an attempt to write down a bunch of observations and
    idioms I've noticed, as a curiosity and perhaps also a guide to folks
    contributing more crosswords.</p>

    <h3>Wit is more important than difficulty.</h3>

    <p>While it is usually more enjoyable if a puzzle offers <em>some</em>
    challenge, it is cleverness and insight that really makes a good puzzle.
    When thinking of clues, you often want to choose the most unexpected and
    surprising clue for each answer, rather than whatever is most likely to
    stump the reader. One should also have taste in how the whole set of clues
    fits together, of course, since you can go overboard in picking bizarre
    clues; the point is just that your goal is not to prevent the reader from
    finding the solution, but rather to teach them something or perhaps make
    them laugh out loud, like when they hear a good joke.</p>

    <h3>The clue and answer should agree.</h3>

    <p>For example, if the answer is plural ("picks"), the clue should also be
    plural ("guitar playing tools"), and if the answer is singular ("pick"),
    the clue should also be singular ("guitar playing tool"). Similarly, if
    the answer is a verb ("pick"), the clue should also have verb-looking clue
    ("play the guitar"). There are lots of other linguistic features that
    should match, such as tense, person, mood, etc. It's not important to
    understand all of these - I generally just follow my gut.</p>

    <h3>The clue should roughly be a definition of the answer.</h3>

    <p>At first it may feel like crossword clues are just free association with
    the answer, but in my experience they are almost always a definition of the
    answer. They aren't always the most obvious or complete definition, but
    they do describe <em>one</em> meaning of the answer. What you don't want to
    happen is for someone to get stumped, look at the solution, and then think,
    "How was I supposed to figure that out?" Instead, they should think, "Ohhh,
    duh!" or maybe, "Ahh, okay, I guess so; that was tricky." Not every clue is
    going to be a success for every person, but you should at least play fair
    and not make people read your mind.</p>

    <h3>Word play should sometimes be in the form of a question.</h3>

    <p>Word play is a great thing to incorporate into your clues, but be aware
    of when it is a bit of a stretch. If so, you can add a question mark at the
    end to denote that it is a stretch. This signals to the reader that the
    connection is a stretch and that they should perhaps do this clue toward
    the end of the puzzle, since it is probably harder than the others. You
    shouldn't make <em>all</em> the clues be extremely tricky like that, but
    it's fun to have one occasionally.</p>
