    <title>On writing interactive UIs with straight-line code.</title>

    <h1>On writing interactive UIs with straight-line code.</h1>

    <p>The first several programs I wrote were command-line apps that used C#'s
    <code>Console.ReadLine</code> method to get input from the user. It was simple,
    blocking, direct, straight-line code; whenever I wanted something from the
    user, and asked for it and waited until they replied. There are a lot
    convenient things about this style of user interface.</p>

    <p>Later, when I learned to build graphical programs and web apps, I
    transitioned to using event handlers that would modify some data that would
    then get rendered on the page. It was tricky, asynchronous, callback-heavy,
    and scattered code; whenever I wanted something from the user, I gave them
    a button to click, added a click listener to update some state, and
    then read that state in the place where I actually wanted it.</p>

    <p>The main pain point of this later approach that I wish I could get away
    from is that all state must be explicit. I'm not referring to the state the
    gets displayed to and modified by the user; that always needs to be
    explicit. What I'm talking about is the state of some interaction flow.
    It's the progress that the user has made through some function, and the
    information about which variables are available for computation. In the
    first approach, this state was kept implicitly by the programming
    language's scope, and the runtime's program counter.</p>

    <p>An analog to this dichotomy exists in other fields of programming. In
    parsing, recursive descent parsers are direct and easy to write by hand,
    while automata parsers are indirect and so annoying to write that we rely on
    tools like Yacc to generate them. Another example is the recent trend for
    programming languages to support <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>
    keywords to facilitate clean asynchronous code; before these features
    existed, programmers had to choose between "callback purgatory" and making
    the state of the control flow totally explicit.</p>

    <p>Here is an idea for how to make UI programming more convenient: enrich
    the kind of requests that <code>Console.ReadLine</code> can make. Instead
    of asking for plain text, the function should present a rendered snippet of
    HTML and wait for the user to interact with it. The function would return
    the specific interaction performed by the user, and then the rest of the
    code can branch on it and perform computations until it eventually calls
    <code>Console.ReadLine</code> again.</p>

    <p>The result of this ida is that you write programs whose execution steps
    through various UI states. The user, then, is the agent that determines
    which branches of execution to take.</p>

    <p>The mention of <code>Console.ReadLine</code> is purely for concreteness.
    In reality, you might have some monadic library with a <code>present</code>
    operation. Application code would be written inside this monad, and there
    would be a separate <code>eval</code> function that drives the UI forward
    as guided by the user.</p>
