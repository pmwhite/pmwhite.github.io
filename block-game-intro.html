  <p>This page is a tutorial for how to play the <a
    href="/block-game.html">block game</a>; tap on the page to make it go
  fullscreen. Try to get the red square from the left all the way to the right;
  to move the square, you can use arrow keys on a computer, or tap on a
  quadrant of the screen on a mobile device. Green columns are checkpoints. You
  can jump forward and backward between checkpoints by swiping left and right,
  but this should not be considered a true solution; it is just a convenience
  in case you get stumped or need to pick up from where you left off last.</p>
