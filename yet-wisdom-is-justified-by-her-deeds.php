<p>Sometimes people begin, either in debate or in their own thinking, first by
settling beliefs and then by discovering the behavior produced by such
beliefs. In my view, beliefs and behavior are not so easily disentangled,
especially when it comes to communicating our beliefs to others; that is, it is
often difficult to truly understand what someone believes until they explain
how it affects their behavior.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the (in)famous "sandwich debate". Some take an extreme
view that anything between two other things counts as a sandwich. In this view,
a board of would between two slabs of rocks would count as a sandwich; even
three molecules in a row count as a sandwich, since one of them is between the
other two. Some who oppose this view reject these examples because they are not
food; a sandwich is for eating, they say. But even amongst this view there is
disagreement on how to address hot dogs and tacos.</p>

<p>Which view is right? Of course, it depends on the context in which the word
"sandwich" was used. If someone says, "go make me a sandwich," they'll be
disappointed if you bring brack two rocks with wood in between. But if they
instead say, "sandwich that wood between these rocks," it wouldn't be
appropriate to complain that such a setup is not technically a sandwich because
you can't eat it. The point is that context matters, so the sandwich debate is
about <em>semantics</em> instead of <em>truth</em>. Neither view is "right";
rather, they are more or less useful in different circumstances. Those engaged
in the sandwich debate do not actually disagree on anything; rather, they are
merely speaking different languages (or, if you like, different dialects of the
same language).</p>

<p>The sandwich debate is a silly one, but there are a lot more serious matters
that have a similar pattern. Sometimes friends and spouses get into seriously
tense arguments about a topic on which they agree about everything but the way
they explain their position. Theological debates, too, often end up
missing the crux of the matter due to a mere disagreement in terms (more on
this later).</p>

<p>In my view, truth is fundamentally related to behavior. If a tree falls in
the forest and no one is around, does it make a sound? I choose not to engage
with the question, since it makes no difference to me. I'm not merely
uncurious; it is additionally my belief that something is not true unless it
affects an observer in some way. Not that a proposition is false if it has no
effect on anyone - it is just <em>moot</em>.</p>

<p>The view I have just expressed may sound post-modern and relativistic, and
in some ways it is, but it does not reject objective reality. If you say,
"quiche is the yummiest breakfast," I'll happily reply, "That's true for you, but
not for me." What I would mean by that is that <em>you</em> should adjust your
behavior based on that statement, but I should not (in fact, I very much
dislike quiche). In contrast, if you say, "I bet jumping off a cliff is a lot
of fun," I'd instead say, "you're in for a rude awakening." Truth is a servant
of reality.</p>

<p>Interestingly, reality is not a hard master. Often there are multiple models
of reality that turn out to be suitable. The foundation of physics has gone
through several iterations, including Newton's Laws, Einstein's Relativity, 
Quantum physics, and a wealth of other outlandish new ideas. Each model has its
strengths and weaknesses, but they're all true in the sense that they are
<em>useful</em>. Truth has some flexibility in everyday life, too. What if I,
too, decided to model my behavior off the assumption that quiche was the
yummiest breakfast? I would end up eating a lot more quiche, which would result
in more unpleasant breakfasts, but also more healthy ones, since I would be
eating more eggs and fewer donuts. Would it then be true that quiche is yummy
to me? In most cases I would say no, but if I'm hanging out with my health nut
friends, I might say something like, "man, I sure do feel good after eating
quiche", which isn't too far off saying that it's yummy.</p>

<p>I hope it is already evident where I stand on this, but I want to be clear
that I believe in absolute truth, and the importance of honesty. When speaking
to others, we're in a shared context in which we generally know how they will
understand something we say; thus, it is dishonest to say something we know to
be false and then say, "well, I was not technically lying, since it's true in
this other context." To the contrary, in my view the honest thing to do is to
take into account the current context at all times. If anything, I think my
view of truth values honesty more high and judges it more strictly than simpler
views on truth.</p>

<p><b>In short, what I'm advocating for is that if you are going to debate a
strong philosophical opinion, be prepared with a reason why your opinion
matters. In other words, what behavior change does it call for?</b></p>

<p>One of the debates that motivated this essay is the classic question of how
God's sovereignty interacts with man's free will. Calvinists tend to emphasize
God's sovereignty more than free will, and armenians tend to do the opposite;
compatibilism is the view that both coexist in a mystery that cannot be
fully understood by our limited capacities.</p>

<p>I've participated in this sort of debate countless times, usually taking the
compatibilist view, with a stronger emphasis on calvinism for whatever reason.
Every time, I come away disappointed with the result; I've never succeeded in
changing anyone's mind, and I always end up feeling like we haven't actually
gotten to the heart of the matter. The discussion often gets stuck on more
abstract points like whether God is 100% sovereign, whether sovereignty and
free will contradict, if sovereignty turns people into robots, and whether
God's work stops at regeneration or goes all the way to saving faith.</p>

<p>What <em>is</em> the heart of the matter? Again, the point of this essay is
that a philosophical position is fundamentally related to the behavior it
prescribes. The Bible tells us many things about God, man, and how they should
relate; some are more abstract and some are more concrete, but they all are
meant to change us. As I've tried to argue here, truth is never about filling
out brain with fun facts; it's about equipping for good works.</p>

<p>I don't plan to avoid debates about election in the future, but I do plan to
focus far more heavily on behavioral questions, and I expect to find a lot of
common ground, and perhaps to discover the <em>actual</em> disagreements that
exist. My experience is that many calvinists actually do believe in evangelism,
and many armenians believe that God's plans cannot be thwarted and God will
sustain the believer to the end. But there are lot of nuanced behavior
questions that perhaps they would have differing views on. How obnoxious should
evangelism be? Should we be doing alter calls all the time, or take a more
reserved approach? If someone leaves Christianity, should we attempt to win
them back? I have thoughts on each of these questions, of course, but this is
beyond the scope of this essay.</p>

<p>As a final note, I'd like to point out a couple places where the Bible seems
to take the same view of truth that I do. First, in Matthew 11:19 (ESV), Jesus
says, "Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds." The context is that no matter
what Jesus did, the Pharisees would always take issue; they could never be
pleased. If he ate food they would call him a drunkard, but if he fasted they
would say he has a demon. But Jesus responds by noting that wisdom is proven
right by the fruit that it produces; they could call Jesus a drunkard all they
want, but he made the blind see, the lame walk, the deaf hear, the sick were
healed, and the lost were saved. It's not that the wisdom itself is
unimportant, but the clearest demonstration what it is really all about is in
the deeds that it produces.</p>

<p>Second, consider 1 Corinthians 8, in which Paul addresses the matter of
eating food offered to idols. He say, "knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."
(ESV), by which he means that the brain knowledge behind our actions is often
less important than the heart. In his example, even if we have the knowledge
that its okay to eat food offered to idols, it's still important to be
considerate of those whose conscience keeps them from doing so. So our goal in
seeking truth is not to merely find the correct facts and know the right
things, but also to build up our own character and the character of those
around, so that we can honor the Lord with what we <em>do.</em></p>
