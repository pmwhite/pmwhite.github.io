    <h1>Technical english.</h1>

    <p>This is an experiment in designing a programming language meant to
    readable in natural language. Toward that end, we take the following
    general choices:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Words (and sometimes punctuation) should be used instead of symbols.</li>
      <li>Comments and code should be able to be mixed freely, and in the same sentence.</li>
      <li>The structure of code should read like natural language and support
        many of the same constructs as the host language, but it does not need
        to support all the constructs of that language. Instead, there should
        be a switching mechanism between comments, which may use any language
        but have no impact on the program, and actual code, which follows rigid
        rules.</li>
      <li>It should be a "kitchen-sink" language (many overlapping constructs)
        rather than a minimal foundation language (a few base orthogonal
        constructs on which others can be built) to enable flexibility in how
        writers structure their syntax.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A program can define new words by wrapping its first usage in quotes.</p>
