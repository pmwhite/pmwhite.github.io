    <h1>Modularity is about dependencies.</h1>

    <p>Sometimes I see people attempt to make programs more modular by
    taking a big file and splitting it into a bunch of small files, or by
    grouping related stuff into folder and namespaces. I think these things are
    distractions from real work and hacks to workaround shortcomings in one's
    tools or abilities.</p>

    <p>Modularity really comes from a lack dependencies between parts of the
    system. By "dependency" I mean not only the library and rule dependencies
    explicit in the build system, but also he numerous implicit dependencies
    between modules, functions, and even sub-expressions within a function. A
    dependency is any assumption that one part of a program makes about another
    part.</p>

    <p>My view is that improvements to modularity are changes that improve
    the dependency graph of the program. It is difficult to actually construct
    this graph, since it is unclear what granularity of dependency is
    appropriate, but you can at least form a vague picture of some of the nodes
    and edges that make up the macro-structure of the part of a system that the
    change affects.</p>

    <p>I have a few heuristics about what makes a "good" change to a dependency
    graph:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Small graphs are better than big ones. Avoid adding more nodes
        and edges than required by the problem.</li>
      <li>Edges are worse than nodes. Feel free to add more nodes if it allows
        you to remove some edges.</li>
      <li>Short dependency chains are better than long ones. Sometimes it is
        worth increasing code size a little bit to avoid depending on a node
        which itself has a chain of dependencies.</li>
    </ul>

    The baseline dependency graph should come from the domain that the program
    is for. Thus, there is a limit to how far the size and complexity of the
    graph can be reduced. All the variability comes from the impedence mismatch
    between the theory of the domain and the concrete implementation on
    physical hardware within the required efficiency constraints. The goal is
    to minimize the extra nodes and edges added to the graph due to this
    mismatch.

    <h2>Interfaces are not modularity.</h2>

    <p>I'm an advocate for strong and statically-checked interfaces between
    modules. However, interfaces are orthogonal to the view I'm expressing
    here. Splitting a single module into two modules does not make the program
    more modular. Rather, it merely exposes the dependency structure between
    the two parts. The interface is both documentation of the existing
    structure and also a barrier against that structure being violated, but it
    does not add structure by itself.</p>

    <h2>Namespaces and files are not modularity.</h2>

    <p>Namespaces and files are just boxes. You can use them to categorize
    functions and types and all sorts of things, but they don't add structure.
    Like interfaces, they can be used to document some existing structure, but
    even for that use case they are faulty because there are no static checks
    that everything has been put in the right box.</p>

    <p>I have felt for a long time that namespace and files are overused. As an
    observer, it seems to me that people use them to get that warm and fuzzy
    "neat desk" feeling. Nice file structure might help them navigate a code
    base better or avoid having an overwhelming amount of context present on
    their screen. I have these feelings myself, but every time I indulge them,
    the result has felt like a waste of time and effort.</p>

    <p>Some concessions I'll make are that sometimes tools interact poorly with
    certain namespace and file structures. For instance, really big files often
    mean longer compile times and slower editor and IDE tools; my code files
    rarely get to the point of slowing down my editor, but commands like
    "type-at-cursor" and "go-to-definition" can get noticeably slower. These
    sorts of concerns are pragmatic and language-dependent, and they do not
    hurt my overall point.</p>
