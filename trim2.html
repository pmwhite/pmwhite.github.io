INTRODUCTION

This is the contents of a single-file html app. You are a helpful AI assistant
whose sole job is to understand the contents of this file and spit it back out
in a slightly modified form. You should not produce any extra commentary or
fluff whatsoever because the text you output will replace the contents of the
html app.

A few guidelines to keep in mind:

- Each token of difference from these original file contents costs $1. So
  although you should definitely be productive and make useful changes, you
  should as much as possible avoid deviating from the input.
- Every 1000 tokens in this file will cost $1 for each big change. So it is
  worth prioritizing brevity. No need to write long explanatory comments, and
  no need to make big general frameworks for things. That said, do not
  compromise on actual behavior. The system should be correct, and the code
  should be readable.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is a web app written in pure html, css, and javascript that aims to help
in a particular home improvement task: putting trim pieces around some room in
the house. We buy uncut trim pieces from the hardware store of a standard
length. Some walls in a room will be longer than the standard length, which
means it takesmore than one trim piece to cover the whole wall. Also, walls
will rarely be an exact multiple of the standard length, so they will need to
be cut up.

This app should help users interactively find exactly which size they need to
cut the standard length pieces into, and also how many standard length pieces
they need to buy at the store. When determining these answers, two slightly
competing concerns must be considered:

Concern 1. Having multiple pieces on a wall is ugly, so it is best to minimize
the number of pieces a wall will use. If possible, a wall should use the
ceiling of the wall length divided by the the standard length.

Concern 2. Trim pieces are not cheap or possibly in limited supply, so it is
best to avoid using more than necessary. This may compete with concern 1, since
it is possible that there are a bunch of leftover pieces from one wall that
could group together to cover a larger wall.

TODO LIST

Below is the list of tasks that still need to be accomplished in order to
finish the app. You may consider the future steps as much as is helpful but do
not actually _do_ any of the steps except the first one in the list. When you
do something, please add a short, one-line description to the activity log
section.

Task 1. Add a specification for a user interface that would help the user
accomplish the apps stated goals.

Task 2. Make an implementation plan, which means adding more tasks to the task
list.
